No. The conclusion doesn't entail the automatization mechanism.\n   - However, [c12] could be seen as nearly equivalent to the consequent of [c40], just with added examples.\n\n**The main issue**: The premises describe a *conditional pathway* (IF extensive practice, THEN automatization, THEN possible), but the conclusion makes an *unconditional capability statement*. The conclusion would logically follow if we added an implicit premise that \"humans do engage in extensive practice\" or if the conclusion were softened to \"can (with extensive practice).\"\n\nREDUNDANT_PREMISES: None\nDEGENERATE_PREMISES: None\n\nVALID: NO\nEXPLANATION: The premises establish that simultaneous performance becomes *possible* through a specific pathway (extensive practice \u2192 automatization), but the conclusion asserts a general capability statement without confirming that this pathway is actually realized. There's a gap between conditional possibility and actual capability.\nSUGGESTIONS: Add a premise stating \"humans do engage in extensive practice of such motor tasks\" or modify the conclusion to \"humans can simultaneously perform 2+ independent motor tasks when they have extensively practiced them.\""
