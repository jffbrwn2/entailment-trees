    "answer": "Question and scope. We interpret \u201ctypical sensitivity of ultrasound transducers for medical imaging\u201d as the receive free-field voltage sensitivity of individual imaging-array elements in water/tissue, commonly expressed as V/Pa or in dB re 1 V/Pa around the center frequency. Transmit sensitivity is Pa/V and is not the focus here (though one example is noted).\n\nDefinitions. Receive sensitivity SR = Vout/Pin (V/Pa). In decibels, SR,dB = 20\u00b7log10(SR/1 V\u00b7Pa\u22121). Measurement is usually via calibrated hydrophone methods outlined for medical transducers. (gururaja1985piezoelectriccompositematerials pages 7-9)\n\nRepresentative values in imaging bands.\n- PZT/composite arrays (3\u20135 MHz): A phased-array test array intended for superharmonic imaging showed ~21 \u00b5V/Pa at \u22483.2 MHz, i.e., SR \u2248 2.1\u00d710\u22125 V/Pa (\u2248 \u221293.6 dB re 1 V/Pa). (neer2010ultrasonicsuperharmonicimaging pages 94-97)\n- Flexible piezo imaging arrays (\u22485 MHz): A body-conformal 64-element imaging array reported ~4.68\u00d710\u22126 V/Pa at 5 MHz (\u2248 \u2212106.6 dB re 1 V/Pa). The same work reported a transmit pressure sensitivity of ~80 kPa/V for a separate modulation array (for context). (pashaei2020flexiblebodyconformalultrasound pages 10-12)\n- Optical/electronic-photonic receivers (~5 MHz): A CMOS-SOI microring-resonator-based ultrasound receiver reported 7.3 mV/kPa, i.e., 7.3 \u00b5V/Pa (\u2248 \u2212102.7 dB re 1 V/Pa); an alternative derivation from reported currents and transimpedance yields ~1.5 \u00b5V/Pa (\u2248 \u2212116.5 dB re 1 V/Pa), in the same order of magnitude. (zarkos2023fullyintegratedelectronicphotonic pages 8-10, zarkos2023fullyintegratedelectronicphotonic pages 7-8)\n\nSynthesis (typical range). Combining these measurements, per-element receive sensitivity for medical imaging arrays operating in the ~1\u20135 MHz band is typically on the order of a few to a few tens of microvolts per pascal:\n- Roughly 5\u201325 \u00b5V/Pa, corresponding to about \u2212107 to \u221292 dB re 1 V/Pa, depending on frequency, element size, backing/matching, and technology. Optical microring receivers fall toward the lower end of V/Pa but can offer competitive NEP. (neer2010ultrasonicsuperharmonicimaging pages 94-97, pashaei2020flexiblebodyconformalultrasound pages 10-12, zarkos2023fullyintegratedelectronicphotonic pages 8-10, zarkos2023fullyintegratedelectronicphotonic pages 7-8)\n\nNotes and caveats. Reported sensitivities vary with frequency (often peaking near resonance), aperture/element area, matching layers, backing, and preamp loading. Standards literature emphasizes careful hydrophone calibration and accounting for frequency-dependent sensitivity and spatial averaging. (gururaja1985piezoelectriccompositematerials pages 7-9)"
